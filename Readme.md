# ðŸ©º Chest X-Ray Disease Prediction (CXR-Diagnostics)

![Dashboard Image](Image/1.png)

An end-to-end deep learning solution for classifying chest X-ray images into three categories: **COVID-19**, **Normal**, and **Viral Pneumonia**. This project features a fine-tuned ResNet50 model, optimized with TensorFlow Lite, and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Problem Statement

The timely and accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonia is crucial for patient treatment and controlling public health crises. Manual analysis of chest X-rays can be time-consuming and requires expert radiologists. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an automated tool that uses deep learning to provide a fast, accurate, and accessible preliminary diagnosis from chest X-ray images, assisting healthcare professionals in the screening process.

## Features

-   **Multi-Class Classification:** Accurately distinguishes between COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia.
-   **High-Performance Model:** Built using transfer learning with a fine-tuned **ResNet50** architecture, achieving **over 96% accuracy** on the test set.
-   **Model Optimization:** The final model was quantized using **TensorFlow Lite**, reducing its size by ~75% (from 240 MB to ~60 MB) for efficient deployment.
-   **Interactive Web Application:** A user-friendly and responsive web interface built with **Streamlit** for easy image uploads and instant prediction results.
-   **Deployment Ready:** The application is structured and prepared for one-click deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud.

## Methodology

The project was executed in several key phases:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** The image dataset was loaded and preprocessed on the fly using Keras's `ImageDataGenerator`. This included resizing all images to a consistent 224x224, applying aggressive data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flips) to prevent overfitting, and normalizing pixel values.
2.  **Model Building:** A **ResNet50** model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, was used as the base. The top classification layer was removed and replaced with a new custom head suitable for our three classes.
3.  **Training & Fine-Tuning:** The model was trained in two phases:
    -   First, only the custom head was trained with the base model's layers frozen.
    -   Then, the final few blocks of the base model were unfrozen and the entire model was fine-tuned with a very low learning rate to adapt its features to the X-ray data. **Class weights** were used to handle the imbalanced dataset.
4.  **Model Quantization:** After training, the final `.keras` model was converted to a `.tflite` (TensorFlow Lite) model. **Post-training quantization** was applied to reduce the file size and improve inference speed.
5.  **Application Development:** An interactive web application was developed using **Streamlit** to provide an easy-to-use interface for the model.
